## Customization

### Adjust Speed

Edit the `slowMo` value in the test file:

```typescript
// In e2e/scope-demo-simple.spec.ts
test.use({
  launchOptions: {
    slowMo: 800, // milliseconds - increase for slower, decrease for faster
  },
})
```

### Adjust Typing Speed

Change the `delay` parameter:

```typescript
await input.pressSequentially('Text here', { delay: 120 }) // 120ms per character
```

## Troubleshooting

### Browser closes immediately
**Issue**: You closed the browser manually
**Solution**: Let the demo run automatically - don't close the browser

### Port already in use
**Issue**: Port 5173 is occupied
**Solution**:
```bash
# Kill any existing Vite processes
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill
# Or stop your dev server before running the demo
```

### Elements not found
**Issue**: App is loading slowly
**Solution**: The demo already has generous waits. If needed, increase timeout values in the test file.

### Test fails but browser worked
**Issue**: Demo ran but Playwright reported failure
**Solution**: This is normal if you manually interacted with the browser. The demo still worked visually!

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Close other applications** - Reduces system load
2. **Use a large monitor** - Easier to see details
3. **Disable notifications** - Prevents interruptions
4. **Run one demo at a time** - Better performance
5. **Full screen the browser** - Better visibility
6. **Watch the console** - Shows progress
7. **Don't click in the browser** - Let it run automatically

## Recording the Demo

To record as video, you can use:

1. **Built-in screen recording** (Mac):
   - Press `Cmd + Shift + 5`
   - Select screen area
   - Start recording
   - Run `npm run demo:scope-simple`

2. **Playwright video recording**:
   - Edit the test file and add:
     ```typescript
     test.use({
       video: 'on',
       launchOptions: { slowMo: 800 }
     })
     ```
   - Videos saved in `test-results/` directory

## For Presentations

Best settings for live demonstrations:

```bash
# Slowest, most visible
npx playwright test e2e/scope-demo-simple.spec.ts --headed --slow-mo=1200

# Or edit the test to set slowMo: 1200
```

This gives plenty of time for audience to see each action.
