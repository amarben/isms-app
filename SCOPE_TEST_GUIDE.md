# Scope Creation Test - Video & Narrative Guide

## Quick Start

### Run Scope Test with Video Recording (Headless - 2x Faster)
```bash
cd isms-app
npm run demo:scope-narrative:video
```

This will:
- Run the test in headless mode (no browser window)
- Record a video of the entire workflow
- Generate a narrative markdown file
- Complete in approximately **30-40 seconds** (2x faster than before)

### Run Scope Test with Browser Visible
```bash
npm run demo:scope-narrative
```

Watch the test execute in real-time with the browser visible.

## Output Files

After the test completes, find your outputs in the `test-results/` directory:

### 1. Video Recording
Location: `test-results/<test-name>/video.webm`

- Full video of the scope creation workflow
- Shows all 5 steps of the wizard
- No scrolling - smooth step-by-step transitions
- Ready for presentations or documentation

### 2. Narrative Script
Location: `test-results/scope-creation-narrative.md`

- **16 detailed narrative steps** explaining the workflow
- Each step includes:
  - **Action**: What's happening on screen

## Performance Improvements

### Speed Optimizations Applied:
‚úÖ All wait times reduced by 50%
- Button clicks: 1000ms ‚Üí 500ms
- Step transitions: 2500ms ‚Üí 1250ms
- Input fields: 1500ms ‚Üí 750ms
- Text entry delay: 100ms ‚Üí 50ms per character

‚úÖ Video recording enabled for all runs
- Config changed from `video: 'retain-on-failure'` to `video: 'on'`

‚úÖ No scrolling required
- Tests use native step navigation
- Smoother video output
- Better visual experience

## Viewing the Video

### On macOS:
```bash
open test-results/*/video.webm
```

### On Windows:
```bash
start test-results/*/video.webm
```

### On Linux:
```bash

## Step 1: Dashboard Access

**Time:** 0.0s | **Action:** Dashboard Access

The user accesses the ISMS application and arrives at the main dashboard.
This landing page provides an overview of the organization's ISO 27001
implementation journey...

> The dashboard is designed to give users immediate insight into where
> they are in their ISO 27001 journey and what tasks require attention.

---

## Step 2: Scope Definition Navigation

**Time:** 1.0s | **Action:** Scope Definition Navigation

The user clicks on "Define ISMS Scope" in the sidebar navigation...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Video Not Recording?
Check `playwright.config.ts` line 14:
```typescript
video: 'on',  // Should be 'on' not 'retain-on-failure'
```

### Test Running Too Slow?
Verify wait times in `e2e/generate-narrative.spec.ts`:
- Most waits should be 500-750ms
- Step transitions should be 1250ms
- Character delays should be 50ms

### Narrative Not Generated?
Check console output for:
```
üìù Narrative saved to: test-results/scope-creation-narrative.md
```

If missing, check file permissions in `test-results/` directory.

## Advanced Usage

### Run with Different Browser
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/generate-narrative.spec.ts --project=firefox --grep 'Scope Creation'
```

### Run with Debug Mode
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/generate-narrative.spec.ts --debug --grep 'Scope Creation'
```

### Change Video Quality
Edit `playwright.config.ts`:
```typescript
use: {
  video: {
    mode: 'on',
    size: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }
  }
}
```
